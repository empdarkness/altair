### Note: Some commands have slash equals with guided assistance.
## Warframe
- **Riven Sniper - RM & WFM**
	- Usage: `a/sa dm/#channel weapon *args`
	- Ex: `a/sa dm kronen -p critdmg range -n finisher -2p1n -c "<@&123456789>`
	 	- To set it up to a guild channel, you will need administrator perms.
	 	- When specifying a weapon, if a base variant exists, use that one's name.
	 	- Behavior is extremely similar to the riven browser, it needs to be using the same [arguments](https://github.com/empdarkness/altair/blob/master/rm.md).
	 	- You can use the keywords `Any`, `all`, or `None` as the stat and `Any` in a weapon position, however you cannot use `Any` on both weapon and a stat, this is by design.
	 	- Additionally: The keywords will override the section it is placed in. Only `Any` works in a positive position, all 3 work in the negative position.
		- The amount of positive and negative stats you can have is uncapped, however if you go above 3 on positive, you must have at least 3 of the positive stats for it to be considered a match. If you go above 1 negative, it will only need to match one of them.
	- Additional args: 
	 	- `-t 1337` - plat threshold, it will only post rivens equal to or below this price
	 	- `-2p1n` - Adding this will make the configuration only look for rivens with 2 positives and 1 negative.
	 	- `-g` - Grades it for every variant of the weapon.
	 	- `-c "<@123456789"` - You can add text to be sent with the posting, you can use up to 255 characters. In order to use a role, type it out like you're gonna ping it.
	 	- `-e 50` - Endo/plat checking, this is the only exception to the `Any` weapon and `Any` stats rule. You can only use those two together if you specify this argument. There is a catch to wfm rivens with infinite buyout, this will only work on those with a starting price equal to or above 100, this is to reduce the spam of 1 plat infinite buyouts.
	- Alt Usage:
	 	- `a/sr id` - Snipe config removal, if linked to server channel, you can force remove it with admin perms
	 	- `a/sl` - View the total amount of listings setup. If you use it in DMs, it will look for ones tied to you, and if used in a guild, it will look up ones tied to the guild.
	 	- `a/sb dm/guild -a/-r/-c user` - RM User Blacklist (Guild/Direct Message)
	 		- Ex: `a/sb dm -a user1,user2,user3`
			- View: `a/bl` in dms or guild to view respective list
			- You will need admin perms to add a user to the guild blacklist. It will default to DM mode if you try and do not have admin perms.
			- Modes:
				- `-a` - Adds to blacklist
				- `-r` - Removes from blacklist
				- `-c` - Clears blacklist, user arg wont do anything

- **Manual Grading**
	- Usage: `a/grade tenet_envoy 64cc 52.4cd 45.8ms -41.3impact` `a/g vectis 69.5ele 88.8cd 76.8heat 58.5recoil`
	- Use `-r` and a number between 0 and 8 to grade it based on the riven rank. This argument is optional as it grades it maxed as default.
		- You only need to designate a non-recoil negative. Recoil is automatically handled as a negative if it has positive stats.
	- Alt Usage: `a/grade https://warframe.market/auction/613eb4eebf237003f3ffb7a1` (Only wfm links work)
		
- **Riven Ranges**
	- Usage: `a/range Archgun/Rifle/Shotgun/Pistol/Melee -p 3 -n 1 -d 1.5`
		- `-p` `-n` Designates how many positives/negatives the riven has.
		- `-d` Disposition to scale ranges.

- **Riven Browser**
	- Usage: `a/r <weapon> <optional args>`
		- Gets list of rivens from provided args.
		- Sorted by price
		- Warframe.Market rivens have a filter. They will not appear if the owner has not been online in 7 days.

	 - Usage: `a/s "Enemy or Specter" CurrentLevel MissionLevel new/old/current`
		 - Calculates DPH, Armor, Health, Shields, EHP, and Damage Reduction
		 - Can use old/new/current scaling formulas. Default usage is current scaling, If mission level is above 100, it will change to calculate for Steel Path Scaling. You can override this.
		 - Enemies do not have public base damage values. As such, the only damage related thing shown is their multiplier.
		 - When calculating things such as EHP, there is no consideration in damage types. 
		 - You can append `-w Exergis` to the command to have it calculate the scaled damage of any weapon.
