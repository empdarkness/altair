- **Riven/Lich Sniper - RM & WFM**
	- Usage: `/sniper`
	- To set it up to a guild channel, you will need administrator perms. Use route argument.

		- Notices are posted with the most recent relist by same seller/list by another seller/similar seen.
			- The criteria for being seen with another seller is a 1 to 1 copy of the stats.<br>Relisted requires the seller to be the same and have the same stats, doesnt show if a slight variation.<br>Similar requires the seller to be different, matching stat names, and a variation in stat values.
			<br>ðŸ”¸ Riven was seen with another seller. Emperor - 1/99999
